	Jojo is a 11 month old Yorkie MinPin that I rescued from a shelter. Finny, or his more sophisticated name Finn is a goldfish I purchased with my partner when I was buying dog food before the lockdown began. In a world where they can’t coexist, they somehow make me feel like I am capable of coexisting in between their realities. They may have differences but they both comfort me in any possible way they can. If it were up to me and the space in my home, I’d rescue all the dogs and all the fish I could. Unfortunately that reality is beyond me and I am grateful for what I have. I somehow feel as if they both understand my pain, they see me in my most vulnerable state. I am grateful for The joy they bring me and the way they make me feel like I have a purpose at home to take care and nourish something that is my own.
